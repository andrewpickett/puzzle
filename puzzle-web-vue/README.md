# puzzle-web (Vue.js)

## Overview
This is the front-end code for the puzzle application. This particular version is written in Vue.js, utilizing npm and webpack for dependencies and build as well as Bootstrap 4 for styling. This was my first attempt at building a front-end application using all these "modern" tools (I had used jquery and JSPs extensively before).
