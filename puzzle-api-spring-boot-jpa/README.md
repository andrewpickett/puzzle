# puzzle-api (Java - Spring, JPA)

## Overview
This is the server-side code for the puzzle application. This particular version is written in Java. Specifically, it uses Spring Boot and JPA. I had never actually used JPA (I had always done straight JDBC for database interactions), so I really wanted to try to do everything using JPA standards.
