# puzzle-api (Python)

## Overview
This is the server-side code for the puzzle application. This particular version is written in Python. It is my first attempt at creating a python _application_ (and not just scripts). As a result, I'm sure there are things that are not exactly "pythonic" about it, but I'm doing this coming from 15+ years of Object Oriented Design...so give me a break!
